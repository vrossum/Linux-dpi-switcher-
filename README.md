Scripts to DPI of desktop automatically when switching monitors

These are some scripts that are hopefully in the following scenario:
You have a laptop that you sometimes connect to an external monitor, so you switch from laptop display only to external only.
However, the DPI needs adjusting for instance because the screens have very different sizes or resolutions.

Comments and improvements welcome.
